![dog or cat?](/env/lolcat.png)

# pet-getter

> to use this yourself to get pet names create a .env file with your own petfinder api credentials 
and them just run python3 main.py, run it in a virtul environment btw. This generates two files containing 2000 
dog and cat names respectively as well as two json files of dog and cat breeds.... enjoy! (?) 

> the files are already pregenerated so if you want your own data delete them (json and text files in dog/cat directories)
otherwise the script will output a file already exists method
